First SFT:
digraph {
0 [label="0"];
0 -> 0 [label="[A-Z]/
x -> x + 32"];
0 -> 0 [label="[\u0000-@\[-`{-\uffff]/
x -> x + 0"];
0 -> 0 [label="[a-z]/
x -> x + -32"];
}
First SFT restricted:
digraph {
0 [label="0", peripheries = 2];
0 -> 0 [label="[a-z]/
x -> x + -32"];
0 -> 0 [label="[A-Z]/
x -> x + 32"];
0 -> 0 [label="[\u0000-@\[-`{-\uffff]/
